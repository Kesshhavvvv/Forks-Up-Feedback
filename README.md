## Project Overview
For our project with SoDA's track Educational Technology, we helped create a simple, accessible web platform that provides educational trivia questions across various subjects to reinforce learning for students in underdeveloped countries. The goal is to offer an engaging way for students to access knowledge, practice essential skills, and discover new topics even in low-internet conditions.

**Project Inspiration**

Our team was inspired by SoDA's educational track because, as students, we recognize how transformative education can be. We've seen how students in low-income countries often face significant barriers to accessing quality learning materials, with many lacking internet connectivity and reliable resources. This challenge inspired us to develop Quiz Quest, a simple and static website aimed at promoting education and providing a meaningful learning experience.

## What It Does
Quiz Quest is a lightweight, static trivia website with a focus on making education accessible in areas with limited internet access. The website features four core educational categories, each with two levels of difficulty, offering students a simple yet effective way to learn and test their knowledge. With Quiz Quest, we aim to offer a fun and educational resource thatâ€™s accessible to students regardless of their location or socioeconomic background. We believe that even small, engaging interactions with educational content can make a big difference by encouraging curiosity, reinforcing classroom concepts, and helping young learners feel empowered to explore new topics on their own terms. 

**Key Features**

1. Four Trivia Categories
      Art
      Literature
      Math
      Science
   
3. Two Levels of Difficulty for Each Cateogry
      Beginner Level: Tailored for younger students or those new to a topic, with straightforward questions and foundational concepts.
      Advanced Level: For students with a stronger grasp of the topic, featuring more challenging questions that encourage deeper thinking and application.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend development: HTMl, CSS, JS, Bootstrap.css framework
  
## Challenges and Learnings

As a team, we encountered many challenges in structuring the website due to a gap in knowledge of Git concept and the programming languages we knew. We faced issues when we were brainstorming whether we should implement an API through ChatGPT and Gemini. We decided not to do that because the APIs did not provide the results of what we needed. Working on this project deepened our understanding of frontend development. Collaborating together was invaluable, as we combined our strengths to overcome technical hurdles and deliver a functional solution.

## Next Steps

In the future, we plan to develop a user-friendly frontend interface that will allow students to interact with the system seamlessly. Using machine learning through Python and ChatGPT algorithms will enable us to create custom questions and options for each category. Additionally, we aim to add challenge questions when the user gets a certain amount of questions correct. Based on the points calculated from all the questions, a leaderboard and ranking will be added against other users which will be integrated through a backend server that will store user information, scores and types of questions answers. This will motivate the students to use this platform more often and they will feel inspired from gaining knowledge. This experience has reinforced our commitment to creating impactful solutions that facilitate students and learning opportunities for youth in underdeveloped countries.
